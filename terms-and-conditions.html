      <p class="paragraph-text text-page">Welcome to the Dovinia Chocolates website. The following are the terms and conditions for use and purchase of products from Dovinia Chocolates. Your use of the Dovinia Chocolates website constitutes your agreement to follow and be bound by these terms, which may at any time, be amended. Your use at any time thereafter constitutes your agreement to be bound by the terms as amended.
        <br>
        <br>Orders are processed on weekdays from 9am to 5.30pm only. While we make every endeavour to process any order placed prior to 11am GMT on the same day, during busy seasonal periods, bank holidays and public holidays your order may not be dispatched for up to 72 hours after you place it.
        <br>
        <br>CUSTOMER SERVICE:
        <br>At Dovinia Chocolates we are committed to providing the highest levels of customer service and our online service is no exception:
        <br>
        <br>ORDER CANCELLATION/RETURNS POLICY:
        <br>We want you to be 100% satisfied with the products you receive and the service we provide, so if there is any issues with your order, then please do not hesitate to contact us by email: info@dovinia.com or telephone +353 86 1936574 and we will be happy to rectify it as swiftly as possible.
        <br>
        <br> If for any reason you are not completely satisfied with any of our products, simply return them to us within 7 days with an explanation and we will be happy to provide a replacement, exchange or refund.
        <br>
        <br>ORDER PROCESSING:
        <br>We are committed to processing your orders as quickly as possible (and will notify you of any issues with your order as soon as possible once it has been placed) so that you are kept fully informed of how your order is progressing.
        <br>
        <br> If for any reason the product you have purchased is temporarily out of stock, then one of our sales team will contact you by telephone or email. In this case you can either decide whether to substitute the product for another item in our range of equal or greater value, or you can choose whether to cancel your order.
        <br>
        <br>ORDERS BEING SHIPPED TO WARM CLIMATES
        <br> In order to ensure the best possible outcome for orders being shipped to warmer climates (particularly during summer months), we kindly request that all customers provide an address where your chocolates can be safely delivered by the courier on their first delivery attempt (i.e. work address). We cannot take responsibility for melted or stolen chocolates in situations where customers have authorised couriers to leave parcels on doorsteps etc. Dovinia Chocolates will naturally do its very best to ensure that shipments to warmer climates are appropriately packaged to avoid temperature damage, however chocolate by its very nature is prone to heat damage and so this needs to be considered by customers when placing orders for shipment to these regions.
        <br>
        <br> DELIVERIES
        <br>Deliveries occur on Monday to Friday only. There is no option currently for Saturday deliveries or timed deliveries. In order to help us deliver your package as quickly and efficiently as possible, please provide us with the recipient's telephone number and directions for our courier if the recipient is located oustide a major city.
        <br>
        <br>Please note that all orders shipped by standard post are at customer's own risk and we would always advise, whenever possible, that customers choose trackable postal or courier options.
        <br>
        <br>We will deliver to the address as you enter it and cannot accept any liability for late or failed delivery if the quoted address, phone number or other contact details provided are incorrect. Please therefore be extremely careful and vigilant when entering delivery address details on our checkout page.
        <br>
        <br>Dovinia Chocolates does not accept any responsibility for delays in the receipt of orders due to unfavourable weather conditions, customs clearance, customs inspection or any other issue out of our control. Please note that delivery charges on our website do not include VAT or customs charges and recipients outside of the EU may be subject to taxes, duties or customs charges upon delivery.
        <br>
        <br>Dovinia Chocolates products are not offered on a sale or return basis and all goods remain the property of Dovinia Chocolates until all outstanding debts have been settled in full.
        <br>
        <br>Dovinia Chocolates reserves the right to refuse to supply any individual or company and reserves the right to deny access to the www.dovinia.com website.
